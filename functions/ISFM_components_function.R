### ISFM 2 mineral fertilizer ###

#With mineral fertilizer, there are short term benefits but in the long run yield start declining
#because mineral fertilizer alone is not sustainable and leads to soil degradation 
# such as nutrient depletion and loss of organic matter, acidification, and chemical pollution (Titonell & Giller, 2013)
#these phenomenon are cumulative, not linear and in many cases happen simultaneously

#### Farmers typology based on resources ###
## To use the most beneficial ISFM, a farmer must have some vital resources 
#These resources were identify leading to different farmers typology or persona# 
#Land, finance, knowledge and labor were considered very important##
#But in this study, the effect of only the first 4 resources will be considered#
#Each for men and women

### ISFM economic outcomes when all ressources are available ###

#### Economic outcomes based on land ####

## Not every farmer own land in northern Ghana due to certain norms
#Land access is also influenced by farmers gender (intersectionality)
#There is also a high probability of land litigation due to land tenure insecurity
#land-less farmers will have to rent land, or pay with some part of their produce to the land owner every season
#Additionally women are given the least fertile land by the men
#This makes land a very volatile asset as its costs will vary highly affecting the outcomes
# We model the probability of an eviction event starting from year 2

#availability of agricultural inputs is influenced by finance
#Only the able and well connected farmers will be able to afford the inputs at the appropriate time

#### Knowledge is an important resource in adoption of ISFM ####
#If farmers use ISFM required inputs without following the right advice and knowing the proper inputs to use
#they will make mistakes and waste resources which may affect their benefits
#however over the simulation farmers learn by doing after making mistakes, so this has a learning curve
#Ideally they are supposed to be trained before they adopt but for those who can't access training
#they learn by doing or seeing from their peers so they start with high mistakes but improve over time
