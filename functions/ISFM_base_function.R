#ISFM base function##

#This script contains the general function that will estimate the costs, the 
#benefits, the risks and the outcomes of the statusquo and the different ISFM components
#This function has arguments that will be applied later to each of the options with their specific values


## There will be five different outcomes following 
#the sustainable intensification assessment framework (SIAF) with its 5 indicators
#Productivity, income, environmental, social and human domains
